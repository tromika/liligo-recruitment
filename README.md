Take-home challenge:

Really useful for test skills, screen and allows you to access their technical and communication skills.

* A short challenge that the candidate don't know in advance. This assignment should test the growth mindset how the candidate adapt new things. Also, this should be a quick assessment on s(he) meets the expectations or not.

* Basically, this would be a much longer task and we interested in more details. This could be a great showcase that the candidate can do and assess how the candidates use their knowledge of programming, statistics, and machine learning to solve the problem. For data scientist, we use an analysis challenge, for engineers it's a use case assessment and we're focusing on the thinking of the candidate.

Some tips:
* First of all, research research research. Check how others do it.
* Focus on more on the future and not the past during the interviews
* Use more take-home challenge rounds for assessing different aspects
* Avoid easy-to-practice questions and validate cultural fit
* Assess a candidateâ€™s ability to learn, adapt, innovate or solve a problem
* Minimize questions about lexical or theoretical knowledge. It's now the age of google.
* Assessment days are a good way to know each other
* We think don't start with a large assessment as a first step because that provides unfair message
* Whiteboard coding misleading and doesn't bring valuable insights
* Strive for a versatile and balanced team - gender is also a dimension
* Don't look for yourself
* Understand the Market
* Show enthusiastic in interviews because that person may be your next colleague
* Invest time and you get the return
* Make it transparent
* Use candidate experience surveys for continually refine your interview skills and processes


take-home challenge tips:
* Do not share datasets and challenges that have connected to your daily job. You know it better than anybody so you overly biased and can't estimate the difficulty or the required time for that
* Validate the take home challenge on yourself or on your colleagues
* Be as detailed as you can
* Validate with a member of your team who was not involved in the recruitment process
* Use English is the must
* Sometimes questions are more important than any result
* Make sure it's useful for screening
* Impress with a cool assessment
