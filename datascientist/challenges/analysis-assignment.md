With this task we assess your technical and data presentation skills and your analytical rigor.

The reproducible analysis is one of the key parts of data science so I'd ask you to create a public repo on a revision control and source code tracking service (preferably Github, Gitlab or BitBucket).
So please during your analysis please use this repository to track your main activities what is related to your assignment.

The topic of this analysis will be bike sharing. Our business a bit different but ppl'd go from A to B and this is similar what liligo do.

You can find the data here: http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data
You have to work with only the "YEAR 1 DATA" dataset but please keep in mind the reproducibility. In the compressed file you'll find the necessary information what you needed to understand the domain.

What we would like to see is 5 interesting findings about the dataset. You get free hands what you deliver so it could be simple stats, predictions, connections and coherences with highlighting your best skills and knowledge. You can use any software, language or tools but your workflow should be shareable and readable in your public repo.

The format what we'd like to get is a presentation about what you did. You can submit your work in format(pptx, Prezi or any other online service) and please include your public repository also.
