### R version
So we're interested how you can solve a minor task on an unknown field with your theoretical knowledge. As I remember you have limited experience with R so now you have to solve a little R task.

Before you start init a repo for this challenge and submit your solution with your other assignment. We would like to check how much time does it take to you so please do it at the same time and don't forget about your last commit.

The task will be the following:

Take the 3 list below and return the Pearson correlation for each pair.  Also print after the correlation coefficient are the lists significantly different from each other or not.

Here is a sample result(the text or the format may differ):

Correlation: 0.9  - No difference


A <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)

B <- c(1,1,42,3,5,5,45,7,21,9,11,67)

C <- c(12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)

### Python version

So we're interested how you can solve a minor task on an unknown field. To avoid problems with installation and environments etc. we recommend to use an online IDE like ideone.com or something else. Before you start init a repo for this challenge and submit your solution with your other assignment. We would like to check how much time does it take to you so please do it at the same time and don't forget about your last commit.

The task will be the following:

Take the 3 list below and return the Pearson correlation for each pair. Also please interpret correlation coefficients for each pair with predefined sentences. Make sure you avoid errors.

Here is a sample result(the text may differs):

0.9 - Strong relationship


A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

B = [1,1,42,3,5,5,45,7,21,9,11,67]

C = [12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
