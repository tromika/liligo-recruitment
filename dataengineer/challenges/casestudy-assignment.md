Let’s imagine a travel metasearch company. For logging user behavior on their webpage the obvious choice is Google Analytics. After using it for some years the company decided that they would need a more flexible solution.

Your task is to find a tool they can use for logging and storing clickstream information. Let’s say that there are 100 different events on the page that should be logged (together with user and timestamp information). In the last year Google Analytics logged around 10 billion events on the webpage.

The new system should be able to handle this amount of traffic. It should also have to possibility to be fully customized.

Please write down which tool/tools you would use for this purpose. Specify tools, platforms with which the data would be logged, collected, stored and made available for analysis. You can propose different tools or methods for logging/collection/storing/retrieval if you’d like. You can also compare similar tools emphasizing their strength and weaknesses. In all cases please explain your choices!

You don’t have to implement anything we are just curious how you think about these kind of challenges. It’s just a hypothetical task, so feel free to explore tools that you haven’t used yet!

The output can be a word document, an email, a readme file, a presentation, or whatever is convenient for you. But please keep in mind that we are mainly interested in your reasons for choosing tools not in the tools themselves.
